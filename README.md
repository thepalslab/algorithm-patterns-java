### ðŸ“Œ Two Pointers

The Two Pointers pattern is used when dealing with **sorted arrays or linked lists** to find a pair, triplet, or subarray that meets certain criteria (e.g., sum, length, duplicates).

**Common Use Cases:**
- Pair with target sum
- Remove duplicates
- Reverse an array in-place
- Compare strings/arrays (anagram, palindrome)

**Example Problems:**
- [x] Reverse Array
- [x] Two Sum II â€“ Input array is sorted
- [ ] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- [ ] Is Subsequence
